• What is aesthetics?
• The Difference Between Metaphysics and Epistemology
   ◦ Metaphysics
</p>
<blockquote>
◦ Questions the ultimate nature of reality
◦ Examples
▸ Do humans exist?
▸ Does god exist?
▸ Does evil exist?
</blockquote>
<p>
   ◦ Epistemology
</p>
<blockquote>
◦ Why are we justified in believing what we do?
</blockquote>

<p>
• What is evidence?
• Deductive Argument Forms
   ◦ Truth-preserving - if the argument is valid and sound, the conclusion is true
   ◦ Modus ponens - Affirming the Antecendant
</p>
<blockquote>
◦ Affirming the Antecendant
◦ "The way that affirms by affirming"
◦ Form
▸ If p, then q
▸ p
▸ Therefore q
◦ Example
▸ If there is fire, there is oxygen
▸ There is fire somewhere
▸ Therefore there is oxygen somewhere
◦ Logical problem of evil
</blockquote>
<p>
   ◦ Modus tollens
</p>
<blockquote>
◦ Denying the Consequent
◦ "The way that denies by denying"
◦ Form
▸ If p, then q
▸ Not q
▸ Therefore not p
◦ Negation - ! operator in computer science
◦ Example
▸ If there is fire, then there is oxygen
▸ There is not oxygen
▸ Therefore there is not fire
◦ Kant-Frege objection
</blockquote>
<p>
   ◦ Fallacies
</p>
<blockquote>
◦ Affirming the Consequent
▸ Form
▹ If p, then q
▹ q
▹ Therefore p
▸ Example
▹ If it is raining, then it is precipitating
▹ It is precipitating
▹ Therefore it is raining
◦ Denying the Antecendant
▸ Form
▹ If p, then q
▹ Not p
▹ Therefore not q
▸ Example
▹ If it is raining, then it is precipitating
▹ It is not raining
▹ Therefore it is not precipitating
</blockquote>
<p>
   ◦ Strong vs ampliative
</p>
<blockquote>
◦ Inductive arguments can <span id="Arguments and Logic:-amplify"></span><strong id="amplify">amplify</strong> our knowledge
◦ Deductive arguments rearrange held knowledge
</blockquote>
<p>
• Inductive Argument Forms
   ◦ Never truth-preserving
   ◦ Inductive Generalization
   ◦ Argument by analogy - two forms of objections
   ◦ Strength is determined by degrees of probability
   ◦ Ampliative - conclusion contains more info than premises
</p>

• Causal version of the Cosmological argument (CAUSAL)
   ◦ There are things which came into existence
   ◦ Whatever comes into existence is caused to exist by something else
   ◦ There cannot be an infinite series of past causes
   ◦ Therefore there was a first cause (God)
• Contigency version of the Cosmological argument (CONA)
   ◦ Form
</p>
<blockquote>
◦ The physical universe exists
◦ Either the physical universe is necessary or contingent
◦ The physical universe is not necessary
◦ Therefore the physical universe is contingent
◦ The physical universe's existence depends on either
▸ Some other contingent beings
▸ Or a necessary being
◦ PU's existence does not depend on some other contingent beings
◦ Therefore the universe depends on a necessary being (God)
</blockquote>
<p>
   ◦ Contigent vs necessary
</p>
<blockquote>
◦ x is a contingent being iff x exists and could fail to exist
◦ x is a necessary being iff x exists and could not fail to exist
</blockquote>
<p>
   ◦ Third and fifth premise
</p>
<blockquote>
◦ Argument for 3
▸ Everything in PU is contingent
▸ Something that is made of things of a kind is of that kind
▸ Therefore PU is contingent
◦ Argument for 5
▸ If PU depends on contingent beings for its existence
without needing an eventual appeal to a necessary being,
then everything must be contingent
▸ If everything is contingent, then there was a time when nothing existed
▸ If there was a time when nothing existed, then nothing exists now
▸ Something exists now
▸ Therefore PU's existence does not depend on some other contingent beings
</blockquote>
<p>
• Anselm's version of the Ontological Argument
   ◦ Form
</p>
<blockquote>
◦ A being is God iff it is the greatest conceivable being
◦ God exists in thought but not in reality (reductio assumption)
◦ Existence in both reality and in thought is greater than existence in
thought alone
◦ We can conceive of God's existence in reality and in thought
◦ Therefore we can conceive of a being which is greater than God
◦ Therefore we can conceive of a being which is greater than the
greatest conceivable being (contradiction)
Therefore our reductio assumption is false
</blockquote>
<p>
   ◦ Distinction between existence in thought and reality
   ◦ "Perfection-making property"
   ◦ Guanilo's objection - perfect island
   ◦ Kant-Frege objection
</p>
<blockquote>
◦ Form (modus tollens)
▸ If existence is a perfection-making property, then existence is a property
▸ Existence is not a property
▸ Thus existence is not a perfection-making property
◦ Negative existential
</blockquote>
<p>
• Teleological Argument - William Paley
   ◦ Form
</p>
<blockquote>
◦ The systems in biological nature are complex, purposive and intricately-func
◦ Artifacts are complex, purposeive and intricately-func and were designed
◦ Therefore the systems in biological nature are designed
◦ If the world is designed, the designer is the JCM God
◦ Therefore JCM God exists
</blockquote>
<p>
   ◦ Terms
</p>
<blockquote>
◦ Complexity - The more kinds of parts, the more complex
◦ Purposive - Serving as a means to which an end is met
◦ Intricately-functioning - Each part functions individually to serve an end
</blockquote>
<p>
   ◦ Objections to premise three
</p>
<blockquote>
◦ Argument cannot rule out many scenarios - watchmaker God, etc
◦ Comparison is not fair
◦ Darwin's evolution
</blockquote>
<p>
• Logical Problem of Evil
   ◦ Form
</p>
<blockquote>
◦ If evil exists in the world, then God does not exist
◦ Evil exists in the world
◦ Therefore God does not exist
</blockquote>
<p>
   ◦ Denial of premise two - "evil is like the hole in a donut"
   ◦ The Argument from Free Will
</p>
<blockquote>
◦ The existence of evil is not to be ascribed to God, but rather free will
◦ J.L. Mackie's response
▸ It is logically possible that God created humans such that
▹ They have free will and...
▹ They never choose to do evil
▸ Human's don't actually choose evil most of the time
</blockquote>
<p>
   ◦ "Best of All Possible Worlds" response
</p>
<blockquote>
◦ "All is well from God's perspective"
◦ All evil works together to create a world that is the best it could be
◦ Quilt analogy
</blockquote>
