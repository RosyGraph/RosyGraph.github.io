= The Late 19th Century US Economy =

== The Rise of the Industrial Corporation ==

=== 1877: A Snapshot ===
	* The U.S. is poised to become a mature *industrial society*, the second
	  after Great Britain. This will require:
		- New concentrations of *capital*, to invest in expanded factory *plant*
		- New manufacturing *technologies* to exploit *economies of scale*
		- New sources of semi-skilled factory *labor*
	* The U.S. is about to receive its second great influx of foreign
	  *immigration*, this time from Southern and Eastern Europe
	* The U.S. is about to experience its second great pulsation of
	  *urbanization* in the Northeast, Ohio Valley, and Great Lakes
	* The U.S. is about to experience accelerated *income inequality*
	* (The U.S. will not become a “world power” for 40 more years)
	* During this period, you needed two things
		- Economic surplus
		- Large naval force

=== The Late 19th Century American Economy ===
	* The former Confederacy becomes a *peripheral*, poor economic dependency
	  within the Union as the world price for cotton falls
	* Manufacturing enterprises exploit *economies of scale* to defend their
	  profits during a world-wide *commodity price deflation*
	* Railroads create a single, *national integrated mass market* for
	  manufactured goods, while vastly expanding the U.S. steel industry
	* More Americans are drawn into capitalist relations of production,
	  distribution, and consumption as *urbanization* accelerates
		- As population in cities increase, so does violent crime
		- Attractive due to economic opportunity
	* Artisans and craftsmen are *deskilled* as production processes are
	  mechanized and the division of labor creates more semi-skilled jobs
	  	- Artisan: a person who has a high degree of physical skill
		- Only way to increase production is mechanization or apprenticeship
		- *Deskill*: make the skills of a worker obsolete
	* The “great merger wave” of 1895-1900 creates a popular fear of *monopoly*
	  (what actually emerges by 1900-1905 is *oligopoly*)
	* Until Pearl Harbor, the south becomes a third-world "country" in exchange
	  for white supremacy
	* Economies of scale require mechanization

=== The Great Commodity Price Deflation ===
	* Between 1880-1892, wholesale prices for agricultural commodities and
	  manufactured goods declined 30%
	* People's identity came more from what they produced than what they bought
	* Many small farms went into *foreclosure*; many smaller factories and
	  workshops went into bankruptcy
	* Producers could stay in business if they reduced their *costs* of
	  *production* faster than the market price for their product fell
	* Generally, that was only possible through *mechanization*, in both
	  agriculture and manufacturing. However,
	* New mechanical technology was expensive, requiring producers to go into
	  *debt*, which could only be paid back
	* By expanding plant and producing more to achieve *economies of scale* –
	  bigger factories and farms lead to cheaper products
	* *Bessemer Process*
	  
=== Elements of the post-1877 Corporate Firm, ie "Big Business" ===
	* *Limited Liability* for stockholders
	* Much larger long and short-term *capital requirements*
	* Separation of management from ownership
	* Increases in
		- *Scale*: wider geographical distribution of output
		- *Scope*: variety of economic functions performed
		- *Bureaucracy*: impersonal codified procedures
	* Decreases in costs, and thus prices, *to the consumer*
	* Relentless, ongoing *downward pressure* on skilled labor costs and
	  mechanization of production processes
