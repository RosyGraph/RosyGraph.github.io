<ul>
<li>
Recall two results of Berkeley’s criticism of Locke’s
	  Representational Realism:

<ol>
<li>
The Causal Thesis is metaphysically untenable. In fact, the
		   metaphysical argument against this thesis shows us that our
		   sensory ideas could not be the result of causal interactions
		   with a mind- independent physical world.

<ul>
<li>
Corollary of The Interaction Principle: sensory ideas must be
			  caused by entities that are themselves mental.

</ul>
<li>
Locke has no principled distinction between primary and secondary qualities.

<ul>
<li>
Corollary: all the qualities of perceived objects are
			  mind-dependent in the way Locke’s so-called “secondary”
			  qualities are.

</ul>
</ol>
</ul>
			  
<div id="Berkeley's Idealism-Theories of Perceptual Knowledge: Taking Stock"><h5 id="Theories of Perceptual Knowledge: Taking Stock" class="header"><a href="#Berkeley's Idealism-Theories of Perceptual Knowledge: Taking Stock">Theories of Perceptual Knowledge: Taking Stock</a></h5></div>
<ul>
<li>
A) We’ve seen that we cannot, as the Direct Realist says, be
	   directly-perceptually-aware of mind- independent physical objects since
	   this gives rise to logical problems in connection with Leibniz’s Law
	   (i.e. the law of identity).

<li>
B) We’ve also seen that Locke’s position — the claim that we are
	   indirectly-perceptually aware of mind-independent physical objects by
	   being directly aware of sensory ideas which represent them — is
	   untenable. On this view, we can’t penetrate the “veil of perception” and
	   thereby claim to be justified in having perceptual knowledge (or
	   neutralize the “threat” of skepticism, for that matter).

</ul>
	   
<p>
From (A) and (B), as well as (1) and (2), Berkeley concludes that any
tenable theory of perceptual knowledge must commit itself to the
following claim:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
C) In cases of perceptual awareness, we are neither directly nor
	  indirectly perceptually aware of mind-independent physical objects.

</ul>
	  
<p>
Notice, it does not follow from (C) that, in cases of perception, we
aren’t perceptually aware of physical objects. For us as for Berkeley, to
say that you are perceiving a table (for instance) is just to say that
you are perceptually aware of something properly labeled a “physical
object.” All that follows from (C) is that we are aren’t perceptually
aware of mind-independent physical objects, in cases of perception. These
observations, in conjunction with the plausible view that we are only
every directly acquainted with mental entities (“ideas”), naturally
implies the rather astonishing conclusion that physical objects are
mental entities. Here's Berkeley's argument:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
1) Physical objects are those things of which we are perceptually aware.

<li>
2) We are only ever perceptually aware of ideas (or collections of ideas).

<li>
∴) Physical objects are ideas (or collections of ideas).

</ul>

<div id="Berkeley's Idealism-Berkeley’s Idealism"><h5 id="Berkeley’s Idealism" class="header"><a href="#Berkeley's Idealism-Berkeley’s Idealism">Berkeley’s Idealism</a></h5></div>
<p>
Berkeley characterizes Idealism with the following slogan: esse est percipi
(aut percipere). Latin for to be is to be perceived (or to perceive).
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span id="Berkeley's Idealism-Berkeley’s Idealism-Idealism"></span><strong id="Idealism">Idealism</strong>: The view that my being perceptually aware of a physical
		  object is my being directly aware of it, and that physical objects
		  are mind-dependent (i.e. ideas or collections of ideas).

</ul>
<p>
On Idealism, the only things that exist are ideas, or mental entities in
general, and the minds that have them.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
What are ideas? They are those things of which we are directly aware
		  in any of our conscious experiences. Ideas are, by their very nature,
		  dependent upon the existence of something else, namely, the minds
		  that have them.	

<li>
What are minds? Minds are whatever have ideas or, to put it another
		  way, they are the bearers of ideas. Unlike ideas, minds are active
		  mental substances that do the perceiving, thinking, imagining,
		  dreaming, and so on.

</ul>
		
<div id="Berkeley's Idealism-Three Questions a Theory of Perceptual Knowledge Must Answer"><h5 id="Three Questions a Theory of Perceptual Knowledge Must Answer" class="header"><a href="#Berkeley's Idealism-Three Questions a Theory of Perceptual Knowledge Must Answer">Three Questions a Theory of Perceptual Knowledge Must Answer</a></h5></div>
<ul>
<li>
Q1. How should we characterize the objects that we typically say we
	  perceive, that is, the everyday world of tables and chairs?

<ul>
<li>
A1. The world of tables and chairs is made up of mind-dependent ideas
		  (the denial of realism).

</ul>
<li>
Q2. What sort of access do we have to these objects?

<ul>
<li>
A2. Like other mental phenomena, we have direct access to physical
		  objects. In cases of perception there is no mediating element between
		  the objects of awareness and the physical object (like Direct
		  Realism).

</ul>
<li>
Q3. In virtue of what can we justifiably say we know about these objects?
	  How does perception yield knowledge?

<ul>
<li>
A3. We are justified in our perceptual beliefs because they are
		  directly acquired, and no means of securing beliefs about physical
		  objects could be more reliable than one based upon being directly
		  related to them (also like Direct Realism). No room for the “threat”
		  of skepticism to creep in, here.

</ul>
</ul>
		  
<div id="Berkeley's Idealism-The Problem of Unperceived Object"><h5 id="The Problem of Unperceived Object" class="header"><a href="#Berkeley's Idealism-The Problem of Unperceived Object">The Problem of Unperceived Object</a></h5></div>
<p>
On Berkeley’s view, the existence of ideas (and therefore physical objects)
depend upon the existence of the minds: without minds, ideas wouldn’t exist.
This gives rise to a problem, expressed in the following argument:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
(1) Physical objects are (collections of) sensory ideas.

<li>
(2) It is logically impossible for sensory ideas to exist unperceived. 1

<li>
∴ So, it is logically impossible for physical objects to exist unperceived.

</ul>

<p>
The conclusion of this argument is absurd! Things must pop in and out of
existence, according to whether a mind is perceiving them or not!
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Berkeley’s Response: Berkeley affirms the soundness of this argument,
	  holding that the truth of its conclusion is a straightforward consequence
	  of his view. Despite this, he does hold that it is absurd to think that
	  ordinary physical objects pop into and out of existence according to
	  whether we happen to be perceiving them or not. And in order to show that
	  this claim isn’t really a consequence of his view, Berkeley reminds us
	  that the following argument, too, is sound:

<ul>
<li>
(1) Physical objects are those things of which we are perceptually aware.

<li>
(2) We are only ever perceptually aware of ideas (or collections of ideas).

<li>
∴ Physical objects are ideas (or collections of ideas).

</ul>
</ul>

<p>
Since it must be true both that (i) physical objects are ideas (or collections
of ideas) and (ii) that it is logically impossible that physical objects (as
ideas) exist unperceived, it necessarily follows, according to Berkeley, that
some mind or other always perceives physical objects, even when they are not
being perceived by us. Of course, the only mind capable of eternal perception
is God’s mind. So, what the problem of unperceived objects shows isn’t that
Berkeley’s view is wrong, but rather that God exists!
