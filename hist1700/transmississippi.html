Period immediately following the American Civil War

		  political rights for the “freedmen”

</ul>
<li>
Reconstruction produces three Constitutional Amendments

<ul>
<li>
13th , 14th , 15th Amendments - not enforced by Federal Government

Each of these were <span id="The Trans-Mississippi West-Reconstruction-neutralized"></span><strong id="neutralized">neutralized</strong> during the “Jim Crow Era” from the

<ul>
<li>
In Free labor: the worker is

<ul>
<li>
Legally entitled to the “fruits of his labor”

<li>
Working inside a form of contract also binding his employer

<li>
Able to relocate geographically or return home

</ul>
<li>
A worker is unfree when any the above conditions is absent, and the
	  worker no longer possesses agency

<li>
The history of the American South from 1865 to the mid 1960s is
	  fundamentally the history of attempts to retain African-Americans in
	  various forms of unfree labor

<ul>
<li>
Political Rights (a very explicit category)

<ul>
<li>
A “vertical axis:” individual rights vis-à-vis various levels of gov’t

<li>
Secured by law, usually in a constitution

<li>
Examples: First Amendment rights, the right to vote, etc.

</ul>
<li>
Social Rights (a much fuzzier category)

<ul>
<li>
A “horizontal axis:” individual rights vis-à-vis other citizens

<li>
Not secured by law; protected by custom and community norms

</ul>
<li>
Civil Rights (to make explicit that which had been fuzzy)

<ul>
<li>
Non-political social rights so important they must be secured by law

<li>
14th Amendment intended to grant limited civil rights to freedmen

<li>
Disputes over conflicting civil rights must be adjudicated in the courts

<li>
Not effective because unfree labor still exists in the form of chain gangs

<ul>

The U.S. is poised to become a mature industrial society, the second

New manufacturing technologies to exploit economies of scale

<li>
New sources of semi-skilled factory labor

<li>
Britain invests surplus capital, which pays off later in WWII
