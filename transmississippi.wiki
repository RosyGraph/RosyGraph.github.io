= The Trans-Mississippi West =

=== National Developments 1865-1877 ===
	* 1865 - The Civil War ends 
	   * Southern Confederacy is defeated, slavery ends, and the Union is preserved
	   * Former slaves do NOT receive permanent civil rights
	* 1865-1877
	   * Reconstruction
	   * South preserves White Supremacy at the cost of 80 years of Southern
		 economic underdevelopment (the “Jim Crow Era” after the 1890s)
	   * End of first half of US History
	* 1862-1863 - Congress and President Lincoln implement legislation to aid
	  in the development of the “Trans-Mississippi West”
	* 1863-1869 - The first transcontinental railroad (Central U.S.), followed
	  by Northern and Southern TCRRs (finished 1883)
	* 1873-1877 - A depression briefly slows the American economy

=== Reconstruction ===
	* Period immediately following the American Civil War
	* A failed attempt to provide permanent political rights for freed slaves
	* Defeated by a combination of
		* Protracted violent resistance of Southerners (“the Klan”)
		* Gradual waning of Northern states’ commitment to ensure equal
		  political rights for the “freedmen”
	* Reconstruction produces three Constitutional Amendments
		* 13th , 14th , 15th Amendments - not enforced by Federal Government
		* Each of these were *neutralized* during the “Jim Crow Era” from the
		  1890s, preserving White Supremacy in the South until 1960's

=== The Three R's of 1865-1877 ===
	* Restoration
		* Lincoln’s and later Johnson’s “soft” approach, abandoned for...
		* Lincoln chooses Johnson to seduce southerners
	* Johnson regrets the 13th amendment
	* Reconstruction (does *not* occur)
		* The “Radical Republican” approach triggered after 1867 by the
		  Southern “black codes” and President Johnson’s erratic behavior
		* Creates the “Reconstruction Amendments” to the Constitution, which
		  are neutralized by the Supreme Court but are later rehabilitated by
		  the 1964-5 Civil Rights and Voting Rights Acts
	* Southern states were not admitted into congress until they rejoined union
		* States could not rejoin the union unless they radified amendments
		* Some scholars believe those amendments are technically invalid
	* Redemption (*does* occur)
		* “Redeemer” governments take charge after the Compromise of 1877 to
		  defend Southern home rule and White Supremacy
		* Freed slaves are often charged with vagrancy and forced to work to pay fine
		* Most southerners are deeply religious, viewed loss of civil war as God's will
		* In order to be redeemed, you must fall

=== Sharecropping: ===
	* Describes a relationship between an employer and a leasee

=== Free vs Unfree Labor ===
	* In Free labor: the worker is
		* Legally entitled to the “fruits of his labor”
		* Working inside a form of contract also binding his employer
		* Able to relocate geographically or return home
	* A worker is unfree when any the above conditions is absent, and the
	  worker no longer possesses agency
	* The history of the American South from 1865 to the mid 1960s is
	  fundamentally the history of attempts to retain African-Americans in
	  various forms of unfree labor

=== Definitions of Categories of Rights ===
	* Political Rights (a very explicit category)
		* A “vertical axis:” individual rights vis-à-vis various levels of gov’t
		* Secured by law, usually in a constitution
		* Examples: First Amendment rights, the right to vote, etc.
	* Social Rights (a much fuzzier category)
		* A “horizontal axis:” individual rights vis-à-vis other citizens
		* Not secured by law; protected by custom and community norms
	* Civil Rights (to make explicit that which had been fuzzy)
		* Non-political social rights so important they must be secured by law
		* 14th Amendment intended to grant limited civil rights to freedmen
		* Disputes over conflicting civil rights must be adjudicated in the courts

=== Amendment XIII of 1865 ===
	* Section 1
	   * “Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as punishment for
		 crime… shall exist… within the United States”
	* Section 2
		* “Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation”
	* 1865-6 - Several Southern states pass “Black Codes” to circumvent,
	  triggering Radical Reconstruction
	* Later circumvented by the “convict lease system,” widespread in the South
	  during “Jim Crow” from the 1890s to the 1930s
	* Not effective because unfree labor still exists in the form of chain gangs

=== Amendment XIV of 1868 ===
	* Section 1. All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject
	* to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the
	* state in which they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which
	* shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States;
	* nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without
	* due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal
	* protection of the laws...

==== Amendment XV of 1870 ====
	* Section 1
		* “The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or
		* abridged by the United States or any State on account of race, color, or
		* previous condition of servitude.” [italics added]
	* Section 2
		* “Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation”
	* During “Jim Crow” Southern states circumvent this amendment through...
		* Literacy tests
		* The poll tax
		* "Grandfather clause"
	* Voting rights in “deep South” states not fully restored to
	  African-Americans until Voting Rights Act of 1965

== Overview Post-1865 Trans-Mississippi Expansion ==
	* American West is sparsely populated
	* Importance of the transcontinental railroads
		* Impetus for an expanded iron and steel industry (many “spinoffs”)
		* Railroads require many resources - akin to today’s SpaceX
			* Railroad bonds
			* Army engineers map broad railway channels
			* Fed only requires RR companies to purchase every other sq mile
		* An “integrated, national mass market” for mfg goods
		* Nation market is prerequisite for an international one
		* Factories can sell far and wide
	* First the railroads are built, then the farms and towns emerge
	* Western homesteading and the “20-inch rainfall line”
		* The Homestead Act of 1862
			* Applies to individuals, not (railroad) companies
			* Fed gives land to citizens free of charge
			* Before Act, land cost ~$1/acre
			* Not explicitly veteran program, but understood as one
			* Was not gendered - women could purchase, but rarely did
			* Now called BLM land
		* Homesteading, 1865-1885, higher rainfall, milder winters
		* Homesteading, 1885-1900, lower rainfall, severe winters
		* Low agricultural commodity prices and the cycle of debt
		* Average of 20 inches of rainfall west of rainfall line
		* Average of < 20 inches of rainfall east of line
		* ~80% of homesteaders return home
	* Role of cattle ranching and mining in Western development
		* Cattle drive - herd of cattle moved north from Texas to Chicago
		* Before civil war, most protein came from pork and chicken
		* Typical use of cows before civil war
			* One female cow for milk
			* One steer (castrated bull) to pull the plow
		* During Civil War, beef came into the forefront of the American mind
			* Rations for Union soldiers sometimes cut-off by the South
			* This forced Union soldiers to occasionally butcher cattle
		* Mining
			* Two types of metal
				* Precious
				* Monetary
				* Gold and silver
				* Money secured by the value of the metal
				* Risk of hyperinflation - overabundance of currency
			* Non-precious
				* Industrial
				* Electrical infrastructure increases demand for copper

=== Development of the Pacific Slope to 1890 ===
	* By 1890 three centers of urbanization had emerged along the Pacific Slope:
		1. Northern California: San Francisco-Sacramento-San Joaquin Valley
		2. Willamette Valley-Seattle in Oregon and Washington
		3. Southern California
	* The West Coast was ethnically very diverse, but unhappily, with massive
	  expropriation of Mexican land grants and fierce anti-Chinese agitation
	  from labor unions resulting in the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882.
	* Agriculturally, California began to shift from wheat to fruit production
	  after 1890 .

=== 1877 - A Snapshot ===
	* The U.S. is poised to become a mature industrial society, the second
	  after Great Britain. This will require the following
		* New concentrations of capital, to invest in expanded factory plant
		* New manufacturing technologies to exploit economies of scale
		* New sources of semi-skilled factory labor
		* Britain invests surplus capital, which pays off later in WWII
	* The U.S. is about to receive its second great influx of foreign
	  immigration, this time from Southern and Eastern Europe
	* The U.S. is about to experience its second great pulsation of
	  urbanization in the Northeast, Ohio Valley, and Great Lakes
	* The U.S. is about to experience accelerated income inequality
	* (The U.S. will not become a “world power” for 40 more years)
